### Aims

Socio-Spatial Georgia aims to understand the deeper societal implications of large, private-sector, urban development in Batumi and Tbilisi some fifteen years after their emergence, and at a time when Georgia continues to rely heavily on such projects to boost the economy. Our three-year research program relies on qualitative and quantitative data to meet the following objectives:
	
__Objective 1__: quantify the magnitude of these large, private sector developments and assess rates of building completion and vacancy. 

__Objective 2__: investigate how these projects have had social impacts on their surrounding neighborhoods and residents. 

__Objective 3__: unpack how large, private sector developments in Batumi and Tbilisi can be understood relative to global market forces, processes of capital accumulation, and city branding. 

__Objective 4__: scrutenize whether the increase of large corporate development in Batumi and Tbilisi warrants new planning laws and regulations in order to minimize their social impacts. 

### Case Studies:

Socio-Spatial Georgia currently focuses on the countryâ€™s two largest cities of Batumi and Tbilisi. Research findings pertaining to each city will be added here as the project progresses. Please check back regularly for updates.
