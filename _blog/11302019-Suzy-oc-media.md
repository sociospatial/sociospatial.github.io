Prominent regionally-focused news and analysis outlet [OC-Media](https://oc-media.org/in-pictures-ghost-apartments-and-hyperbuilding-in-batumi/) published a photo-essay on Batumi's ghost apartments by Ian McNaught Davis. Our co-PI Suzanne Harris-Brandts was asked to provide a quote regarding on this issue. Suzanne elaborated on the typology of building vacancies in Batumi and explained that many such units are owned, but not actually occupied. This creates a challenge in terms of dealing with the absense of social life around such buildings.
