Over the weekend, our team conducted six intensive focus group discussions in Batumi. Participants were eager to share their ideas regarding large-scale constructions that has swarmed the second largest city of Georgia in recent years. These discussions surely hinted on innate contradictions the process of neoliberal urban development produces. Importantly, our informants debated recent developments about controversial Batumi Riviera project. Findings from these discussions will serve as a stepping stone for our upcoming public opinion polls in Batumi and Tbilisi.
