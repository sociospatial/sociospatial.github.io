Suzy Harris-Brandts presented the results at the Institute of European, Russian, and Eurasian studies (EURUS) of Carleton University ([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8rAkFPE4_s)) and at the Centre for European,  Russian, and Erusian Studies, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto ([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5WOYbAe5Uk)).
