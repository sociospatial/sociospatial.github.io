Dato Gogishvili and Suzy Harris-Brandts published an article titles ["Coinciding practices of exception in urban development: mega-events and special economic zones in Tbilisi, Georgia"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09654313.2019.1701995?journalCode=ceps20) (gated text). The publication explores how a combination of exceptional urban parctices such as special economic zones with mega-events can produce shady and undemocratic governance practices.
